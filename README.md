Puzzle
======

The first game I made using Java.

The Slide Puzzle program displays a grid of tiles that must be arranged in ascending order. The user can click on any tile next to the empty space to move the tile to that space. The game starts with the tiles in a random arrangement. The two diagrams below show the start and final positions of the puzzle.
